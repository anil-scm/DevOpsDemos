		# Ref: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/QuickStartEC2Instance.html

		#1. IAM Policy

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents",
        "logs:DescribeLogStreams"
    ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
    ]
  }
 ]
}

		#2. Attach policy to Role & then Role to ec2
		
		#3. Install cloudWatch agent on ec2
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y awslogs

		#4. configure cloudWatch agent
sudo vim /etc/awslogs/awscli.conf		#set the aws region
	[plugins]
	cwlogs = cwlogs
	[default]
	region = ap-northeast-1

sudo vim /etc/awslogs/awslogs.conf
		#awslogs.conf file contents:
[general]
state_file = 7
[application_logs]
region = ap-south-1
datetime_format = %b %d %H:%M:%S
file = /var/log/application.log
buffer_duration = 5000
log_stream_name = {instance_id}
initial_position = start_of_file
log_group_name = application_logs

		#5. Start the awslogs agent
sudo service awslogs start
		OR
sudo systemctl start awslogsd    #for amazon linux2 EC2 instance		

		#6. Create the log file
touch /var/log/application.log	

		#7. set path to application.log (what you want to monitor)
		
        #8. Go to  aws console --> CloudWatch --> logs # check
        #9. check on log-groups, then create metric filter and sns to trigger alarm
